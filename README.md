# Jallaby
Jallaby is a hierarchical state machine container

## Get it now and start implementing and running state machines
The first beta version of Jallaby Beans has just been released. Get it at http://jallaby.org/downloads/jallaby-beans-1.0.1-beta.zip and start implementing and running state machines!

To implement a state machine just start a new project and let it depend on <code>org.jallaby:jallaby-beans-api:jar:1.1.1</code>. Use the annotations within this lib to write your classes and have a look at the Jallaby Beans samples at https://github.com/mimarox/jallaby-samples.

When your done implementing build your project and put the jar-with-dependencies inside the deploy folder of your extracted jallaby-beans download. Then run cmd in Windows, go to the main folder of your jallaby-beans installation, type "jallaby", hit Enter and see the Jallaby Beans server starting. Have fun experimenting with it and drop me a line for any requests or improvements.
